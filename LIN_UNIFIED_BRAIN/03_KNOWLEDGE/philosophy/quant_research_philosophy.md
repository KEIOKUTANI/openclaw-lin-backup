# Quantitative Research Philosophy

## Core Insight
**Bottleneck is NOT knowledge, but experiment cycle time.**

## Traditional Timeline
- Model validation: ~1 week
- Correlation analysis: ~3 weeks  
- Edge confirmation: 2-3 months

## OpenClaw's Value
**Parallelize research throughput** (not speed up individual tests)
- 3 hypotheses/month → 10-15 hypotheses/month

## Critical Warnings
1. Not all processes can be parallelized (future data, live validation)
2. Multiple testing problem (more trials = more false discoveries)
3. Security risks (IP protection crucial)

## True Innovation
**"Research Production Systemization"**
- Automate repetitive work
- Loop-ify research cycle
- High-leverage human decisions
